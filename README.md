<h1>Overview</h1>

These are examples of the projects I created learning the basics of C#. This repository includes assignments from The Tech Academy bootcamp along with some of my own personalizations as I gained skills and knowledge in Microsoft .NET and the programming language C#.

<h3>Car Insurance</h3>
This project is an MVC web application that mimics a car insurance website. It takes user's input on policy information and calculates a quote based on business logic. There is also an admin page that allows staff to view all of the quotes that have been issued.

This is console application that takes user's input to calcuate a comparison between to users' incomes. 

<h3>To Do List</h3>
In this conosole application I created a basic to do list focusing on encapsulation.
